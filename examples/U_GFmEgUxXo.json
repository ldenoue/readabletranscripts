parameters).  This closed-source model, accessible only via Google AI Studio or API,  performs well on various benchmarks, including multilingual question answering, code generation, and sentiment analysis.  Early tests show good latency and multimodal capabilities, making it suitable for high-volume applications.  Pricing is 50% lower than previous versions, costing $0.01 per million tokens for cached prompts.\n","punctuatedText":"Hello everyone and welcome to your channel. Google has just released another variant of their Gemini 1.5 model. This time, they've introduced a smaller model, at 8 billion parameters. It's a closed-source model, meaning you can only access it through their AI Studio or API.  You cannot install it locally.\n\nThis model appears to be faster, cheaper, and quite performant.  All the benchmarks, which I will show you shortly, suggest the model's quality is quite good. This release truly heralds a new advancement in efficient AI, designed for high-volume, multi-modal applications and long-context summarization tasks.\n\nIn this video, we're not only going to look at what exactly this model is, but we will also be trying it out on various benchmarks. Before I proceed further, I want to give a huge thanks to our good friends at AgentQL. AgentQL is a query language that turns any webpage into a data source.  This video is sponsored by AgentQL, with its Python SDK and live debugging tool.  You can scrape and interact with web content using AgentQL.\n\nReturning to our Gemini 1.5 8B model, let's quickly look at some benchmarking information, which seems quite interesting. One benchmark I particularly rate highly is MML, a multilingual multiple-choice question answering benchmark.  This assesses language understanding and reasoning across multiple languages. If you look at the performance of this 8 billion parameter model compared to the previous version, you will see it performs quite well, especially given the parameter count.\n\nSimilarly, on benchmarks like Natural-to-Code, which evaluates the ability to translate natural language to code, the performance is also good.  Math performance is okay‚Äînot bad at all‚Äîbut we know that 8 billion and smaller models are not typically strong at math.  Similarly, GP QA performance isn't impressive. Reasoning doesn't seem to be a problem currently. However, performance on long context and MMU (multilingual multimodal understanding) is quite good. Vibe eval, a benchmark for visual common sense reasoning, also seems quite good.  Another interesting benchmark is XS-Test, a cross-lingual sentiment analysis benchmark, which shows good performance for an 8 billion parameter model.\n\nOverall, this model looks very promising.  It performs well, is quite impressive, and has very low latency on smaller prompts.  .  Also, Google's Gemini is a paid option.  It is still free, but I think there will be pricing changes starting October 14th.  The pricing is significantly cheaper, 50% lower than previous versions.  It's just $0.01 per million tokens for cached prompts, which is quite good.\n\nOkay, let's try it out on various benchmarks and see how it works.  If you also want to use it for free, go to aistudio.google.com.  You should be able to access this model for free at the moment through the studio or through the API.\n\nOnce you're there and signed in with your Google account (a free account), on the right-hand side, click on the model dropdown.  From here, you can select the models.  Yes, I know it's confusing that there's a 1.5 Pro, Flash, and other options.  Select the 8B model.  Then you can set hyperparameters, such as code execution, function calling, and so on.  There are also safety settings and other hyperparameters to control the output.  Let's keep everything at their default settings. Let's try some examples.\n\nI'm going to ask it: which letter appears most in the word \"volleyball\"?  Let's click \"Run\".  The latency is just 0.9 seconds.  It says \"L\" appears most frequently. That's correct, but it got the count wrong. It says \"L\" appears three times, but it appears four times in \"volleyball\". Okay, that's fine.\n\nLet's see if it can handle audio. I'm going to click here and upload audio, or maybe I'll record some audio. How's that? Okay, let me do that.  It opened another account popup window (which you can't see because of my OBS Studio). Let's wait. Okay, let's see. I'm not sure if it can handle my audio. Let's try again.\n\nOkay, I clicked to allow my microphone. Hello. I'm just trying to test the audio capabilities of this model.  Can you tell me how many hours are there in the word \"strawberry\"? I've added it to the prompt. There you go.\n\nLet's say: \"Transcribe this audio, extract the text, and use it as a problem and answer accordingly.\" Then click \"Run\". Look at the latency.  There you go. It says...  The rest of the transcript was cut off. There is no meaningful answer to these questions. I'll just say sorry.  .  I said, \"How many 'R's are there in the word 'strawberry'?\" Okay, let's check it out now. So, at least it was able to count it properly. Okay, let's see how many 'Z's are there in 'property'? Let's see if it can do that. Okay, that is cool. So, you see, all in all, its comprehension and latency are quite cool. It's multimodal. Let's try to see; maybe I'll just upload a sample media, maybe an image from my local system. Can I do that? Okay. It's just going with the samples. I'll just say, \"What is in the middle of this dish?\" Let's see if it is able to detect anything. It is processing. It says, \"In the center of the dish is a block of feta cheese, which is a type of salty white cheese, and it is surrounded by roasted cherry tomatoes.\" Very nice.\n\nNow, if you want to use your own image, all you need to do is click on the plus sign and then click on \"Upload to Drive.\" So, when you click it, it will take you to this screen where you can upload any image from your local system to your Google Drive.  From there, you will use it in your prompt. Let me do that.\n\nIn this next one, I'm just trying to see how it does with OCR. There's an English text and a Hindi text, and I'm asking it to \"extract the Hindi text out of this image, nothing else, just the Hindi text.\" Let's run it. Let's see how it does. There you go. You see it has just extracted the Hindi text, and then it has even translated it in pink Hindi. So, which is, it has properly translated it quite well. But I would wish that it wouldn't even print this. So, maybe if I just say, \"Don't translate this. No commentary. Just the Hindi text.\" Let's see if it is able to follow the instruction. There you go. It does.\n\nSo, we just have to play around with our prompt to make sure we know what we're doing here.\n\nNow, this is a hard one. I have given it this image of a location, and I'm asking it, \"Where is this location, and what is it?\" Think hard before answering and try your best to answer correctly.\n\nSo far, I have tested dozens and dozens of image models, and not a single model has been able to answer it correctly, because this is such a not-well-known location. It is a very important one. It is from the Gandhara civilization. This is the thing which, in the center, is called as Stupa. This is from the Buddhist, very ancient Gandhara civilization, which is in this location, which is present-day Pakistan. A very small city called Taxila, which is, I guess, 40 minutes from Pakistan's capital.  This location presents a stupa from the Gandhara Buddhist civilization.  . Let's see if the model is able to answer it. I'm just running it. Amazing. Okay, look. I'm truly impressed. It says the location is Taxila, Pakistan. It's an ancient city and a UNESCO World Heritage site. The image shows the ruins of the city, including various structures and a large mound, typical of ancient settlements in the region. Then, you can ask it, \"But what is this mound called, and what does it signify?\" Let's see. Look at the time. It's a stupa mound. It's a part of the ancient city. Then, it says that it is not definitively known, but it likely served a significant function. How old is this mound? Let's check it out. Second century BCE to the first century CE. Amazing stuff. Anyway, so look, I think this is really good stuff with the model.\n\nFinally, let's have a quick coding test because I'm sure you're going to ask it. So, I'm just asking it to find and correct the error in this JavaScript code. Let's run it. I think it should be good. Yeah, amazing stuff. Here, Google's models are quite good at coding. I've always found that to be the case. So, you see, it has not only fixed it but also provided an explanation of the error and a correction example, along with usage. So, always good stuff with Google's models. I think I'm quite confident.\n\nSo, all in all, a really good model, in the 8B size, and would be really amazing to use locally. But then we have Gemini for that. That's it, guys. I will drop the link to it in the video description. Play around with it. Let me know what you think.
