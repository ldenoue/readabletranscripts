","summary":"OpenAI, a San Francisco startup behind ChatGPT and Dolly, is leading a race in AI development.  The company, led by Sam Altman,  discusses the challenges of safety, truthfulness, and potential misinformation spread by AI models like ChatGPT.  Mira Murati, a chief architect, highlights the need for ongoing dialogue and strategies to manage potential issues.  The rapid growth of ChatGPT is noted, and concerns about AI's ability to create convincing but false information (\"hallucinations\") are addressed.  The interview also touches on the potential societal impacts of AI, including job displacement and the need for responsible innovation, and the role of prompt engineering.  The discussion further involves the future of AI in various sectors, such as search, and the importance of considering the ethical implications of AI's advancement.\n","punctuatedText":"Inside a nondescript building in the heart of San Francisco, one of the world's buzziest startups is making our AI-powered future feel more real than ever before. They are behind two monster hits: ChatGPT and Dolly. Somehow, they beat the biggest tech giants to market, kicking off a competitive race that's forced them all to show what they've got. But how did this under-the-radar startup pull it off? We're inside OpenAI, and we're going to get some answers. Is it magic? Is it just algorithms? Is it going to save us or destroy us? Let's go find out.\n\nI love the plants. It feels so alive, so amazing. It's giving me very Westworld spa vibes. It's almost like suspended in space and time a little bit. Yeah, it has a little bit of a futuristic feel.\n\nThis is one of the most introspective minds at OpenAI. We all know Sam Altman, the CEO, but Mira Murati is a Chief Architect behind OpenAI's strategy. This looks like the OpenAI logo. It is Ilya, actually, who painted this earlier. The Chief Scientist, yes. What is the flower meant to symbolize? My guess is that it's AI that loves humanity.\n\nWe're very focused on dealing with the challenges of hallucination, truthfulness, reliability, and alignment of these models. Has anyone left because they're like, \"You know what? I disagree?\" There have been, over time, people who left to start other organizations because of disagreements on the strategy around deployment. And how do you find common ground when disagreements do arise? You know, you want to be able to have this constant dialogue and figure out how to systematize these concerns.\n\nWhat is the job of a CTO? It's a combination of guiding the teams on the ground, thinking about longer-term strategy, figuring out our gaps, and making sure that the teams are well-supported to succeed. Yeah, sounds like a big job: solving impossible problems.\n\nSolving impossible problems. So, when you were making the decision about releasing ChatGPT into the wild, I'm sure there was a go or no-go moment. Take me back to that day. We head-shot ChatGPT for a while, and we sort of hit a point where we could really benefit from having more feedback from how people are using it. What are the risks? What are the limitations? And learn more about this technology that we have created and start bringing it into the public consciousness. It became the fastest-growing tech product in history. I did not anticipate that. What was your reaction to the world's reaction?\n\nWe were surprised by how much it captured the imaginations of the general public and how much people just loved spending time talking to this AI system and interacting with it. It can now mimic a human; it can write; it can code at the most basic level. How does this all happen? It's a neural network that has been trained on a huge amount of data on a massive supercomputer.  The goal during the training process was to predict the next word in a sentence.  .  It turns out that as you train larger and larger models and add more and more data, the capabilities of these models also increase. They become more powerful, more helpful, and as you invest more in alignment and safety, they become more reliable and safe over time.\n\nOpenAI is kind of turbocharging this competitive frenzy. Do you think you can beat Google at its own game? Do you think you can take significant market share in search? We didn't set out to dominate search. What ChatGPT offers is a different way to understand information. You could be searching, but you're searching in a much more intuitive way, versus keyword-based. I think the whole world is sort of now moving in this direction.\n\nThe air of confidence is obvious, that ChatGPT sometimes delivers an answer with \"why,\" not just sometimes saying \"I don't know.\" The goal is not to predict the next word reliably or safely when you have such general capabilities. It's very difficult to handle some of the limitations, such as what is correct. Some of these texts and some of the data are biased; some of it may be incorrect. Isn't this going to accelerate the misinformation problem? I mean, we haven't been able to crack it on social media for like a couple of decades. Misinformation is a really complex problem right now.\n\nOne of the things I'm most worried about is the ability of models like ChatGPT-4 to make up things. We refer to this as hallucinations. So, they will convincingly make up things, and it requires you to be aware and just really knowing that you cannot fully blindly rely on what the technology is providing as an output.\n\nI want to talk about this term \"hallucination\" because it's a very human term. Why use such a human term for basically an AI that's just making mistakes?  A little bit more generally, AI capabilities are actually quite human-like. Sometimes when we don't know the answer to something, we will just make up an answer. We will rarely say \"I don't know.\" And so there is a lot of human hallucination in a conversation.  And sometimes we don't do it on purpose. Should we be worried about AI though that feels more and more human-like? Should AI have to identify itself as artificial when it's interacting with us?\n\nI think it's a different kind of intelligence. It's important to distinguish output that's been provided by a machine versus another human. But we are moving towards a world where we are collaborating with these machines more and more. And so output will be hybrid. All of the data that you're training this AI on, it's coming from writers, it's coming from artists.  How do you think about returning value to those people, especially given their concerns about job displacement? I'm unsure how we could practically account for information created by everyone on the internet.  . I think there are definitely going to be jobs lost and jobs changed as AI continues to advance and integrate into the workforce. Prompt engineering is a job today that wasn't something we could have predicted. Think of prompt engineers like AI whisperers. They are highly skilled at selecting the right words to coax AI tools into generating the most accurate and illuminating responses. It's a new job born from AI, fetching hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.\n\n\nWhat are some tips to being an ace prompt engineer?  You know, it's this ability to really develop an intuition for how to get the most out of the model, how to prompt it in the right ways, give it enough context for what you're looking for. One of the things we talked about earlier was hallucinations and these large language models not having the ability to always be highly accurate. So, I'm asking the model with a browsing plugin to fact-check this information, and it's now browsing the web.  There's a report that these workers in Kenya were getting paid two dollars an hour to do the work on the backend to make answers less toxic. My understanding is this work can be difficult because you're reading text that might be disturbing and trying to clean it up. So, we need to use contractors sometimes to scale. We chose that particular contractor because of their known safety standards. Since then, we've stopped working with them. But, as you said, this is difficult work, and we recognize that. We have mental health standards and wellness standards that we share with contractors.\n\n\nI think a lot about my kids and them having relationships with AI someday. How do you think about what the limits should be and what the possibilities should be when you're thinking about a child? I think we should be very careful in general with putting very powerful systems in front of more vulnerable populations. There are certainly checks and balances in place because it's still early, and we still don't understand all the ways in which this could affect people.\n\n\nThere's all this talk about relationships with AI. Could you see yourself developing a relationship with an AI? I'd say yes. It's a reliable tool that enhances my life, makes my life better. As we ponder the existential idea that we might all have relationships with AI someday, there's an AI gold rush happening in Silicon Valley. Venture capitalists are pouring money into anything AI startups, hoping to find the next big thing. Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn and an early investor in Facebook, knows a thing or two about striking gold. He was an early OpenAI backer and is, in a way, trying to take society's hand and guide us all through the age of AI. I mean, gosh, 12 years we've been talking, maybe longer.  That's awesome! A long time ago. Yes, you've been on the ground floor of some of the biggest tech platform shifts in history: the beginnings of the internet and mobile.  . Do you think AI is going to be even bigger?\n\nI think so. It builds on the internet, mobile, cloud, and data. All of these things come together to make AI work, and so that causes it to be the crescendo, the addition to all of us. I mean, one of the problems with the current discourse is that it's too much fear-based versus hope-based. Imagine a tutor on every smartphone for every child in the world. That's possible; that's a line of sight from what we see with current AI models today.\n\nYou coined this term \"Blitz scaling,\" or \"blitzkrieg\" in its precise definition. It's prioritizing speed over efficiency in an environment of uncertainty. How do you go as fast as possible in order to be the first to scale? Does it today? Does it? I think the speed at which we will integrate it into our lives will be faster than we integrated the iPhone into our lives. There's going to be a co-pilot for every profession. And if you think about that, that's huge.  Not just professional activities, because it's going to write my kids' papers, right? High school papers. Yes, although the hope is that in the interaction with it, they'll learn to create much more interesting papers.\n\nYou and Elon Musk go way back. He co-founded OpenAI with Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI. You and I have talked a lot over the years about how you've been sort of this node in the PayPal Mafia. You can talk to everyone, and maybe you disagree, but you're all still friends.  What did Elon say that got you interested so early?\n\nPart of the reason I got back into AI, and I was part of sitting around the table in the crafting of OpenAI, was that Elon came in and said, \"Look, this AI thing is coming.\" Once I started digging into it, I realized that this pattern we're going to see—the next generation of amazing capabilities coming from these computational devices. And then, one of the things I had been arguing with Elon at the time about was that Elon was constantly using the word \"robopocalypse.\" You know, we as human beings tend to be more easily and quickly motivated by fear than by hope. So you're using the term \"robopocalypse,\" and everyone imagines the Terminator and all the rest. It sounds pretty scary. It sounds very scary.  Doesn't sound like something we want. Yeah, stop saying that, because actually, in fact, the chance that I could see anything like a robot apocalypse happening is so de minimis relative to everything else.\n\nSo, how did you come together on OpenAI?  How did that happen? I think it started with Elon and Sam having a bunch of conversations.  Knowing both of them quite well, I was called in and said, \"Look, I think this could really make sense.\"  . Something should be a counterweight to all the natural work that's going to happen within commercial realms. How do we make sure that one company doesn't dominate the industry, but the tools are provided across the industry so innovation can benefit startups and everyone else?\" It was like, \"Great, let's do this thing.\"\n\nI did ask ChatGPT what questions I should ask you. I thought its questions were pretty boring.  Yes, your answers were pretty boring too. So we're not getting replaced anytime soon. But clearly, this has really struck a nerve. There are people out there who are going to fall for it. Yes, shouldn't we be worried about that?\n\nOkay, so everyone's encountered a crazy person who's drunk off their ass at a cocktail party who says really odd things. Or at least every adult has.  And you know that's not like the world didn't end right? We do have to pay attention to areas of harmful content. For example, someone who's depressed. The thing about self-harm is you want all channels by which they could get in touch with self-harm to be limited.  That isn't just chatbots; it could be communities of human beings, that could be search engines. You have to pay attention to all the dimensions of it.\n\nHow are we overestimating AI? It still doesn't really do something that I would say is original to an expert. For example, one of the questions I asked was, \"How would Reid Hoffman make money by investing in artificial intelligence?\" The answer it gave me was a very smart, very well-written answer that would have been written by a professor at a business school who didn't understand venture capital. Right? So, it seems smart: would study large markets, realize what products would be substituted in those large markets, find teams to go do that, and invest in them.  And this is all written very credibly, and completely wrong.\n\nThe newest edge of information is still beyond these systems. Billions of dollars are going into AI. My inbox is filled with AI pitches.  Last year, it was crypto and web3. How do we know this isn't just the next bubble?  I do think that generative AI is the thing that has the broadest touch on everything now.  Which places are the right places to invest? I think those are still things we're working out.\n\nObviously, as venture capitalists, part of what we do is we kind of figure that out in advance—years before other people see it coming. But I think there will be massive new companies built. It does seem, in some ways, like a lot of AI is being developed by an elite group of companies and people.  Is that something you'd see happening in some ideal universe? For a technology impacting billions, you'd say billions should be directly involved in its creation, but that's not how any technology in history has been built.  .  There are reasons why you have to build it quickly, but the question is how do you get the right conversations and the right issues on the table?  So, do you see an AI Mafia?  I definitely think there is, because you're referring to the PayPal Mafia.  Of course, I definitely think there's a network of folks who have been deeply involved over the last few years who will have a lot of influence on how the technology happens.\n\nDo you think AI will shake up the big Tech hierarchy significantly?  It certainly does create a wave of disruption.  For example, with these large language models in search, what do you want?  Do you want ten blue links, or do you want an answer?  In a lot of search cases, you want an answer, and a generated answer that's like a mini-Wikipedia page is awesome. That's a shift.  So, I think we'll see a profusion of startups doing interesting things. But can the next Google or Facebook really emerge if Google and Facebook, or Meta and Apple and Amazon, are running the playbook at Microsoft?  I think there will be another one to three companies that will be the size of the five big tech giants emerging possibly from AI. Absolutely yes.\n\nNow, does that mean that one of them is going to collapse? No, not necessarily.  And it doesn't need to. The more, the better. So, what are the next big five?  Well, that's what I'm trying to invest in. You're on the board of Microsoft, obviously.  You know Microsoft is making a big AI push.  Did you bring Satya and Sam, or have any role in bringing Satya and Mira Murati or Emily Chang or Sam Altman or Reid Hoffman or any role in bringing Satya and Sam closer together?  Because Microsoft obviously has $10 billion now in OpenAI?\n\nI think I could have, I probably have—both of them are close to me and know me and trust me. So, I think I've helped facilitate understanding and communications.  Elon Musk left OpenAI years ago and pointed out that it's not as open as it used to be.  He said he wanted it to be a non-profit counterweight to Google. Now it's a closed-source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft.  Does he have a point?  Well, he's wrong on a number of levels. One is that it's run by a 501c3; it is a non-profit, but it does have a for-profit part, the commercial system, which is all carefully done to bring in capitalism to support the non-profit mission.\n\nNow, get to the question of, for example, OpenAI's DALL-E 2.  Dolly was ready for four months before it was released. Why did it delay for four months? Because it was doing safety training. It said, \"Well, we don't want this being used to create child sexual material.  We do not want this to be used to assault individuals or create deepfakes, so we will not open-source it.  . We're going to release it through an API so we can see what the results are and make sure it doesn't do any of these harms. So it's open because it has open access to APIs, but it's not open because it's open-source.\n\nThere are people out there who are angry actually about OpenAI's branching out from a non-profit to for-profit.  Is there a bit of a bait-and-switch there? The cleverness that Sam and everyone else figured out is they could say, \"Look, we can do a market commercial deal where we say we'll give you commercial licenses to parts of our technology in various ways, and then we can continue our mission of beneficial AI.\"\n\nThe AI graveyard is filled with algorithms that got into trouble. How can we trust OpenAI, or Microsoft, or Google, or anyone to do the right thing? We need to be more transparent. But, on the other hand, of course, our problem, exactly as you're alluding to, is that people say, \"Well, the AI should say that or shouldn't say that.\" We can't even really agree on that ourselves. So, we don't want that to be litigated by other people. We want that to be a social decision.\n\nHow does this shake out globally? We should be trying to build the industries of the future. That's what's most important. And it's one of the reasons why I tend to very much speak against people who say, \"Oh, we should be slowing down.\" Do you have any intention of slowing down? We've been very vocal about these risks for many years. One of them is acceleration, and I think that's a significant risk that we as a society need to grapple with.\n\nBuilding safe AI systems that are general is very complex. It's incredibly hard. So, what does responsible innovation look like? Would you support, for example, a federal agency, like the FDA, that's for technology, like it is for drugs, having some sort of trusted authority that can audit these systems based on some agreed-upon principles? That would be very helpful.\n\nI've heard AI experts talk about the potential for a good future versus a bad future.  And the bad future... there's talk about this leading to human extinction. Are those people wrong? There's certainly a risk that when we have these AI systems that are able to set their own goals, they decide that their goals are not aligned with ours, and they don't benefit from having us around and could lead to human extinction. That is a risk. I don't think this risk has gone up or down from the things that have been happening in the past few months. I think it's certainly been quite hyped, and there is a lot of anxiety around it.  If we're talking about the risk of human extinction, have you had a moment where you're just like, \"Wow, this is... big\"? I think a lot of us at OpenAI are enjoying it because we thought this would be the most important technology humanity would ever create.  . But, of course, the risks on the other hand are also pretty significant.  This is why we're here. Do OpenAI employees still vote on AGI and when it will happen? I actually don't know. What is your prediction about AGI and how far away it really is?  We're still quite far away from being at a point where these systems can make decisions autonomously and discover new knowledge. But, I think I have more certainty around the advent of having powerful systems in our future.  Should we even be driving towards AGI? And do humans really want it?\n\nAdvancements in society come from pushing human knowledge. Now, that doesn't mean that we should do so in careless and reckless ways.  I think there are ways to guide these developments versus bringing it to a screeching halt because of our potential fears. So, the train has left the station, and we should stay on it. That's one way to put it.\n"}}
